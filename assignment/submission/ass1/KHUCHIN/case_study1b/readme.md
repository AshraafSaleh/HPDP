## 1. Import dataset into Google Sheet

- First we need to download the dataset from the file in GitHub. Then we will open a brand new google sheet. From there we can import the dataset into the sheets. 
- Click on the **File** at the top left corner and then click on the **Import**.

- Then we will see a pop-up and we can click on **Upload**. From there you can just drag the database from your explorer file or browse through your files.

## 2. Create new sheet for general purpose usage

- Now we will create a new sheet and transfer our data into that so that we can use it freely. This serve as a precaution so that if anything happen it does not affect the original database. We will use this new sheet to sort and add new column for later use. You can name the sheet however you like but we will go with "Sorting".
- In order to create new sheet in the same spreadsheet. We can just click on the **+** button at the bottom of the screen.

- Then we can transfer the data by using the copy and paste method. Just press **Ctrl** and **A** on your keyboard to select all. Then press **Ctrl** and **C** to copy the data. After that go to the new sheet we just created and paste the data by clicking on the box in the sheet and press **Ctrl** and **V** at the same time.

## 3. Preprocessing

- For this part, we need to make sure our data is readable ny the computer to ensure smooth calculation and prevent any possible error. As for the database provided, there aren't any missing data or anything that need to be change. How ever for easier usage, we have assigned the month to number so that it is easier to sort. The result is stored in a new column name "Month". We use formula as below:

- Then we will combine the month and the year so that we can differentiate between same month but in different year. The result is stored in a new column name "YearMonth". For this we use this formula as below:

- After that we will sort the data using the "YearMonth" column as our main in ascending order. The formula is as below:
