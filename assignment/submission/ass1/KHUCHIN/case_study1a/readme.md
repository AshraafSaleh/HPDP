### Group Name: KHUCHIN

## Introduction

Google Sheets is a spreadsheet tool that is part of Google's free, web-based Google Docs Editors suite. Google Sheets is accessible as a web app, a mobile app for Android and iOS, and a desktop app for Google's ChromeOS. The software supports Microsoft Excel file formats. Many people, organizations, and corporations use Google Sheets as it provides many variety of features that Google Sheets has capabilities to make many kinds of data management and analytical jobs. Users can use the application to create and edit files online while interacting with other users in real-time. Edits are documented by the user who made them, as well as a revision history. 

One dataset has been chosen for data analysis based on the case study that was given which is the Examination Result dataset. The dataset contains six columns which are Id_no, Academic, Sports, Co-Curriculum, Test_1, and Test_2. By doing this case study, we will show how to make data analysis based on the dataset that has been given based on the case study to turn it from raw data to valuable data.

Based on the dataset, which has a total of 112K records, we may conduct an analysis in which the lowest overall percent that a student receives is 14.82 and the maximum is 98.57, with an 83.75 gap between the two. The overall percentage for students is 69.36. In terms of grading, we may look at the distribution of grades based on the top three highest grades in the dataset, which have high percentages, while the top three lowest grades stand out:

Top Three Highest Grades:
1. A ‚Üí 23,214 Students
2. B+ ‚Üí 13,851 Students
3. B ‚Üí 13,515

Top Three Lowest Grades:
1. E ‚Üí 712
2. D- ‚Üí 1,029 
3. D ‚Üí 1,681

The percentage of students who pass is 63.30%, or 70,594 students, and the percentage of students who fail is 36.70%, or 40,925 students. Approximately half of the students passed the examination, while the remaining students did not meet the required standard to pass the examination.
