## Pivot Table

#### How to create Pivot table

1. In the spreadsheet, select all the values in the dataset by using the command **CTRL A**. Then go to **Insert >> Pivot table**.![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/create%20pivot%20table.png)
2. In the data range option, make sure the value is the one that has been selected before. Make the pivot table in a new sheet.![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/data%20range%20pivot%20table.png)
3. A new sheet will be created which has the pivot table.![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/pivot%20table.png)
   
#### Monthly Sales

1. Create a new pivot table just like the previous step.
2. In the pivot table editor, select:
   * for rows, add **MONTH INDEX** and **SALES MONTH** column. ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/monthly%20rows.png)
   * for values, add **SALES** and **TARGET** column. For both columns, summarize by **SUM**. ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/monthly%20values.png)
3. To create the chart, go to **Insert >> Chart**. In the chart editor, setup the chart as below:
   * Chart type = Stacked area chart
   * Stacking = Standard
   * Data range = B1 : D13
   * X-axis = SALES MONTH
   * Series = Sum of sales and Sum of target
   ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/setup%20chart%20monthly.png)
4. Then customize your chart as you see fit at the customize tab. For example, change the chart title to Monthly Sales.

2. In the pivot table editor, select:
   * for rows, add **SALES REGION**column. ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/region%20rows.png)
   * for values, add **SALES** column. Make sure **SALES** column is summarised by **SUM**. ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/monthly%20values.png)
3. To create the chart, go to **Insert >> Chart**. In the chart editor, setup the chart as below:
   * Chart type = Pie chart
   * Data range = A1 : B5
   * Label = SALES REGION
   * Series = Sum of sales
   ![image](https://github.com/drshahizan/HPDP/blob/main/assignment/submission/ass1/DEADPOOL/case_study1b/images/setup%20chart%20monthly.png)
