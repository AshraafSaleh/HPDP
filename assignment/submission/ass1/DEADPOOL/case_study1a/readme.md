## Dataset Information <a name = "dataset_info"></a>
This dataset describes exam outcomes, allowing us to determine if students passed or failed. There are five factors that go into determining a student's grade: co-curriculum, athletics, academics, tests 1 and 2

**Deadpool Google Sheet**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-a6XEi_X0BPA2ugBbEKP3aqwfWSL5TKOPjdZvjvMh68/edit#gid=1538304567

## Data Import  <a name = "importing data"></a>
1. Download and import dataset1 to google sheet.
